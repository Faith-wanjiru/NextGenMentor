            Before apartheid separated, black South Africans were divided into tribes. These tribes had a long history of conflict, particularly between the two dominant groups, the Zulu and the Xhosa. The Zulu, a warrior people, fought back against European invaders and were killed. The Xhosa people, by contrast, tried to learn from the Europeans and resisted their invasion with strategy instead of violence. Resentment between the two tribes grew during apartheid, and it grew into war once apartheid was ended.

            Even though Christianity had been forced on native South Africans by the Europeans, Trevor’s mother was a devout Christian who took her family to multiple churches every Sunday. Trevor’s mother was never easily intimidated and her faith in God was unwavering. Trevor grew up during apartheid, with a white father and a Black mother when sexual relationships between races were against the law. Officers had a hard time enforcing this law, and many mixed-race children were born during this time.

            Trevor’s existence was against the law, so Patricia had to evade questions about her son’s light skin. It was dangerous for both Trevor’s parents to be seen in public with their son. When Trevor visited his mother’s family in Soweto, his grandmother wouldn’t let him play outside with his cousins, or he would be taken by the police. Therefore he became good at entertaining himself alone indoors. Years later, Noah met mixed-race South Africans who had fled the country. When Trevor asked Patricia why she had not taken him to another country, like Switzerland, she replied that South Africa was her country. She didn’t want to leave.
